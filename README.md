# project0

This my first project in the CS50 Web Programming with Python and Javascript course. I chose to do my project based on one of my favorite mystery books, A Murder is Announced. In the website, I used many Bootstrap classes and included a variety of lists, tables, and images. In this project, I learned to use different attributes in CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.
